# Churn Modeling of ecommerce data

The analysis in this folder is an initial data exploration of simulated ecommerce data. This data is from a [tutorial on Dataiku]  (https://www.dataiku.com/learn/guide/tutorials/churn-prediction.html).

There are two data tables that you will need to download yourself to run the Jupyter notebooks in this folder:

* an [events dataset](http://downloads.dataiku.com/tutorials/v2.0/TUTORIAL_CHURN/events.csv.gz) containing: a user id, an event timestamp, event type, a product id and a seller id. 
* the [product dataset](http://downloads.dataiku.com/tutorials/v2.0/TUTORIAL_CHURN/products.csv.gz) contains a product id, three hierarchical layers of category ids, and price. 

Included Jupyter notebooks:
