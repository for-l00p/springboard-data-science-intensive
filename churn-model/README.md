# Capstone Project: Churn Modeling

I will delve into customer churn modeling for my Capstone project. 

Since real data that we'd want to analyze for customer lifetime value often have sensitive information, openly available datasets are hard to find. I will use a toy dataset emulating the data that an e-business company might have. This data is from a [tutorial on Dataiku]  (https://www.dataiku.com/learn/guide/tutorials/churn-prediction.html).

There are two data tables that you will need to download yourself to run the Jupyter notebooks in this folder:

* an [events dataset](http://downloads.dataiku.com/tutorials/v2.0/TUTORIAL_CHURN/events.csv.gz) containing: a user id, an event timestamp, event type, a product id and a seller id. 
* the [product dataset](http://downloads.dataiku.com/tutorials/v2.0/TUTORIAL_CHURN/products.csv.gz) contains a product id, three hierarchical layers of category ids, and price. 

Included Jupyter notebooks:
* [Preliminary data exploration] ('Churn Model - Preliminary Data Exploration.ipynb') of these datasets
