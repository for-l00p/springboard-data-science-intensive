# Capstone Project: Churn Modeling

I will delve into customer churn modeling for my Capstone project. 

Since real data that we'd want to analyze for customer lifetime value often have sensitive information, openly available datasets are hard to find. I will use a toy dataset emulating the employee data. This data is from [Medium.com on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics).

The data has 15000 simulated employees. Features include Employee satisfaction level, Last evaluation, Number of projects, Average monthly hours, Time spent at the company, Whether they have had a work accident, Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years, Department, Salary, Whether the employee has left.

Included Jupyter notebooks:
